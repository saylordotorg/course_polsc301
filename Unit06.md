    saw for himself (he believed that the wealthy should take care of
    the less fortunate).

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the text of the amendment.  
      
     Note on Text: The Spanish-American War was a conflict in 1898
    between Spain and the United States, as the result of American
    intervention in the ongoing Cuban War of Independence (then a
    Spanish colony).  Entry into the war was somewhat controversial as
    it exposed U.S. imperialist tendencies.  In order to reassure
    anti-imperialist elements on the eve of declaring war on Spain,
    Congress adopted a measure, sponsored by Senator Henry M. Teller of
    Colorado, pledging that the United States would not annex Cuba. 
    While the Teller amendment pledged that the United States would not
    annex Cuba, it did not prevent us from interfering in the internal
    affairs of Cuba after the war was over.

     Instructions: Please read the League’s platform.  
      
     Note on Text: During the late 1800s, the United States acquired a
    number of offshore territories during the so called “Age of
    Imperialism.”  Some of these lands were purchased (for example, the
    United States government purchased Alaska from Russia), while others
    were acquired as a result of military conflict, as was the case in
    Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  During this era, the
    Anti-Imperialist League formed to stop the spread of American
    hegemony around the world.

     Instructions: Please read the text of Hay’s Open Door communiqué.  
        
     Note on the Text: In the late 1800s, many countries (including the
    United States) saw China as a clear imperialist opportunity. 
    Although Americans appeared to have the “best interests” of China in
    mind in this document, Secretary Hay is really articulating
    America’s desire to not be left out of the Chinese markets, even
    though America was not seen as a major “world power” at that time.

     Instructions: Read this article by Francis Walker, originally
    published in the Atlantic Monthly in June of 1896.  
        
     Note on the Text: Francis Walker was a well-respected scholar in
    the 1890s.  This essay expresses the sentiments of many Americans at
    the time concerning the need for restricting immigration.  This
    essay was written just a year before Congress passed a bill authored
    by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge that required all immigrants to be
    literate in English.  (The bill primarily targeted “new immigrants”
    from Southern and Eastern Europe.)  It was later vetoed by President
    Grover Cleveland.

     Instructions: Please read the short introduction and text of
    Washington’s speech at the Cotton States and International
    Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia.  
        
     Note on the Text: During this speech, Washingtonpublicly accepted
    disfranchisement and social segregation as long as whites would
    allow black economic progress, educational opportunity, and justice
    in the courts. Washington’s overall philosophy of accommodation
    rather than agitation of the white racist hierarchy was not without
    its critics, then and today.  For example, W. E. B. DuBois (see
    below) believed the speech was insufficiently committed to the
    pursuit of social and political equality for blacks.

    Century,” DuBois explains the meaning of the emancipation, and its
    effect, and his views on the role of the leaders of his race.
