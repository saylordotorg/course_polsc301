**Unit 10: Contemporary American Thought** <span id="10"></span> 
*The turmoil of the 1960s created a shift in American society and in the
general political discourse.  This shift continues to greatly impact the
political scene today.  Contemporary American thought is not only
influenced by the changes in the 1960s, but also the various traditional
philosophy of American politics in general.  In this unit you will learn
about the immediate fall-out and impact of the 1960s and then explore
how the current political climate relates to the political discourse of
the past.  By the end of this unit, it will be clear that although times
may change, many of the original American political philosophies shape
the contemporary political world.  *

    conservative, sympathetic Americans who were not a part of the
    liberal, radical, or anti-establishment turmoil of the 1960s.

    speech on race in Philadelphia on March 18, 2008.  
        
     Note on the Web Media: This speech was delivered after a series of
    race-related incidents in the 2008 Presidential race.  In
    particular, Obama was responding to the racially-charged remarks
    made by his pastor, Reverend Wright, and the response that many
    Americans had to them.  His speech underscores the progress that the
    U.S. has made on the issue of race relations, but indicates that the
    race question continues to be a part of the American social and
    political dialogue.
