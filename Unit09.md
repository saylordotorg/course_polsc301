**Unit 9: The Sixties: Rebellion and Backlash** <span id="9"></span> 
*Cultural and political changes converged in the 1960s to create a
situation seen by some as a welcome social revolution and by others as
an unwanted, unpatriotic departure from established American ideals. In
this unit you will learn about the changes in the political and social
climate in the United States that would greatly influence American
political thought.   As you learn about the various revolutions in
thought and their philosophical champions, consider the ways in which
these movements affect contemporary political thought.*

     Note on the text: The Port Huron Statement was written after a late
    1962 gathering of college students near Port Huron, Michigan.  This
    group originally came together to discuss politics, but their
    discussions included a number of important topics in American life,
    including civil rights and foreign policy.  At the end of the
    four-day retreat, the students drafted this statement to express
    their overall sentiments on the political and social state of life
    in America.  This document became the underlying foundation for
    student protest and the rise of the student “new left” in the
    1960s.

    other forms of protest throughout the country.  Many influential
    black leaders in American politics today got their political start
    in the SNCC movement; its actions and philosophy has impacted and

    Birmingham City Jail.”  
        
     Note on the Text: Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote this letter from
    jail after being arrested for non-violent protest against
    segregation in Birmingham, Alabama.  King was initially responding
    to a written statement by white Alabama clergymen who called for
    peace and asked protestors to “appeal to law and order and common
    sense” (Statement by Alabama Clergymen: “A Call to Unity,” 1963) by
    calling off the demonstrations.  King expresses his thoughts on this
    proposal and his sense of urgency for an end to racial
    segregation.

    together in support of civil rights.  Although many performers and
    leaders spoke, King’s speech was perhaps the most memorable and
    influential of the day.

    consider why Johnson so aggressively took up the mantle of civil
    rights. On one hand, Johnson has been credited with being one of the
    most important figures in the civil rights movement.  However, some
    critics believe that he was merely an unprincipled politician who
    used the civil rights issue when he realized the worth of the “Black
    Vote.” With which view do you agree more? Why?

    midst of continued protest and anti-war sentiment across the
    nation.  Opposition to the war continued to grow, especially after
    the Tet Offensive and due to the barrage of wartime images presented
    to American citizens on the nightly news.  In this speech, LBJ
    underscores his desire for peace and an end to partisan conflict and
    announces his decision not to seek re-election in the 1968
    Presidential contest.

     Note on the Text: The Goldwater speech was seen as the beginning of
    a more conservative Republican party.  His candidacy marked the
    shift from a more northern-elitist Republican party, to a more
    southern, conservative tradition.  Although the conservative
    revolution would not fully come to fruition until the election of
    Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, the Goldwater speech serves as a clear
    delineation of the conservative backlash that grew out of the
    turmoil in the 1960s and in many ways continues in American politics
    today.

    Link: George McGovern’s “[Announcing Candidacy for the 1972
    Democratic Presidential

     Instructions: Read the text of McGovern’s statement announcing his
    candidacy for the 1972 presidential election.   
        
     Note on the Text: McGovern was seen as the champion of liberal,
    democratic values.  In his announcement, he outlines many of the
    liberal political ideas of the day.  McGovern and the liberals,
    however, were not successful in their bid for a more liberal
    national political agenda; McGovern lost the 1972 election to
    Richard Nixon.

    Kingdom and United States in reference to activists, educators,
    agitators, and others in the 1960s and 1970s who sought to implement
    a broad range of reforms, in contrast to earlier leftist or Marxist
    movements that had focused mostly on labor unionization and
    questions of social class.  In the United States, the “New Left” was
    associated with the Hippie movement and college campus protest
    movements.
