**Unit 2: The Constitution** <span id="2"></span> 
**The Constitution serves as the single governing document in America. 
In order to understand current governance issues, you will benefit from
understanding this document, the basis on which the American structure
is built.*  *In this unit, you will study the roots of the Constitution
and the major debates that surrounded the process of constructing this
framework. You will explore some of the theoretical underpinnings of the
Constitution, such as republicanism, separation of powers, and checks
and balances.  In looking at the debates that surrounded the drafting of
the Constitution, you will uncover not only the viewpoints of  those who
succeeded in their arguments, but also on the  ideas were not accepted
in the final version of this foundational document.**

     Instructions: Read the text of the Articles of Confederation.   
        
     Note on the Text: The Articles of Confederation served as the first
    form of government in America after it declared independence from
    Britain.  The text was heavily influenced by the colonists’ fear of
    a strong executive branch or anything that might resemble the
    monarchy from which they had just escaped.  Accordingly, the states
    are the primary power-holders under the government established by
    the Articles.

     Instructions: Read the text of Hamilton’s letter to James Duane.   
        
     Note on the Text: In this letter to James Duane (Mayor of New
    York), Alexander Hamilton, founding father and federalist, discusses
    some of the problems he has identified in the Articles of
    Confederation.  Hamilton demonstrates not only the weaknesses of the
    Articles, but discusses what he believes would make for a stronger
    government.  Hamilton was not alone in his feelings about the
    Articles of Confederation; in the summer of 1787, there was a
    convention to revise the Articles in Philadelphia.  This convention
    did not revise the Articles, but instead created an entirely new
    form of government which resulted in the U.S. Constitution.
