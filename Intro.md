This course will cover American political thought from the nation’s
early, formative years as a fledgling republic through the 1960s,
exploring the political theories that have shaped its system of
governance.  As there is no one philosopher or idea that represents the
totality of American political thought, you will survey the writings and
speeches of those who have had the greatest impact over this period of
time. You will begin by examining pre-revolutionary thought before
moving on to the ideals and debates that brought forth the Constitution
and the American governmental structure.  Next, you will study the
people and events that shaped the emergent nation, delving into concepts
such as individualism, capitalism, and industrialism.  You will also
investigate the notions of slavery, equality, social progressivism, as
well as the ideals explored in the civil rights movement. You will
notice that much of the study required in this course is based on the
original texts and speeches of those who influenced political thought
throughout American history.  You will learn and evaluate through their
eyes and will discover the impact that their views and actions have had
on the modern American state.   You are encouraged to identify their
continued influence upon current political and social systems.

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as it lays the foundation for
understanding the more advanced, in-depth material presented in latter
units.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **154
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These time
advisories should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful
to take a look at these time advisories and determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals
for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 16.5 hours.  Perhaps
you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1
on Monday night, split subunit 1.2 between Tuesday and Wednesday night,
and so forth.
