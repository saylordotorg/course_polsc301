**Unit 8: Post-War America and Seeds of Civil Unrest** <span
id="8"></span> 
*After World War II, American culture and politics forever changed.  In
the 1950s, the country went through an “age of conformity,” where many
in society and politics looked to instill American ideals and values
upon all citizens.  In addition, the 1950s gave rise to national and
international fears of communist expansion and atomic war.  The events
of the 1950s created a need for change among many in society, change
that would be brought about by a new decade and new struggles.  In this
unit you will explore topics that occurred in the post-war era in the
United States and social and political conditions that were setting the
stage for change in the 1960s.*

    Houston Ministerial Association on the issue of his religion. 
    Kennedy hoped to calm the fears of many Protestant Christians who
    remained concerned about the prospect of a Catholic president.  He
    succeeded in doing so by reaffirming the separation of church and
    state, decrying any mixing of religion and politics, and vowing, if
    elected, never to let his religious views influence his decisions as
    president.  Why do you think the speech was so effective in allaying
    the fears of Protestant Christians?

    is also available for your reference.  
      
     Note on the Text: In 1961, President Kennedy announced the dramatic
    and ambitious goal of sending an American safely to the moon before
    the end of the decade.  He knew it to be a very challenging
    technological feat, but it was an area of space exploration in which
    the United States actually had a potential lead.  Kennedy felt great
    pressure to have the United States catch up to and overtake the
    Soviet Union in the “space race.” Thus the Cold War is the primary
    contextual lens through which many historians now view Kennedy's
    speech.

    Kennedy’s televised presidential address on the Cuban Missile

     Note on the Text: In October 1962, an American U-2 spy plane
    secretly photographed nuclear missile sites being built by the
    Soviet Union on the island of Cuba.  President Kennedy did not want
    the Soviet Union and Cuba to know that he had discovered the
    missiles.  After many long and difficult meetings, Kennedy decided
    to place a naval blockade around Cuba.  The aim of this “quarantine”
    was to prevent the Soviets from bringing in more military supplies.
     He demanded the removal of the missiles already there and the
    destruction of the sites.  On October 22, President Kennedy spoke to
    the nation about the crisis in a televised address.  The Cuban
    Missile Crisis was the closest the world ever came to nuclear war.
