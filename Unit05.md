     Note on the Text: The American Anti-Slavery Society was established
    in 1833 in Philadelphia.  Led by the fiery abolitionist William
    Lloyd Garrison, the society pledged to end slavery in the United
    States. The sentiments adopted at the founding meeting established
    the basic argument of the society for the next three decades,
    namely, that slavery was illegal, if not under the Constitution
    (which Garrison had damned as “a covenant with hell”), then
    certainly under natural law.

     Instructions: Please read the text of “The Declaration of
    Sentiments.”  At a time when traditional roles were still very much
    in place, the Declaration created much controversy.  Many people
    respected the courage and abilities behind it; however, temperance
    and female property rights were major issues at the time, and many
    supporters of women's rights believed the Declaration’s endorsement
    of women’s suffrage would hinder the nascent women’s rights
    movement, causing it to lose much needed public support.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please read the introduction and the text of the
    Gettysburg Address (1863), one of the most well-known speeches in
    American history.  It was delivered by Lincoln four and a half
    months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at
    the Battle of Gettysburg.  In just over two minutes, Lincoln invoked
    the principles of human equality and redefined the Civil War as a
    struggle not merely for the Union but as “a new birth of freedom”
    that would bring true equality to all of its citizens.

     Instructions: Please read the introduction and the text of
    Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address (1865). At a time when Union
    victory was within days and slavery was near an end, Lincoln did not
    speak of happiness, but of sadness. Some see this speech as a
    defense of his pragmatic approach to Reconstruction, in which he
    sought to avoid harsh treatment of the defeated South by reminding
    his listeners of how wrong both sides had been in imagining what lay
    before them when the war began four years earlier. Lincoln balanced
    that rejection of triumphalism, however, with a recognition of the
    unmistakable evil of slavery.

    and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution.  
        
     Note on the Text: These amendments were passed after the Civil War
    in an era that was referred to as “Reconstruction.”  During
    Reconstruction, the federal government attempted to once again unite
    the country.  Many political leaders, however, wanted to ensure that
    the slavery cause for the war was rectified.  These amendments were
    created to ensure that slavery would formally end and that former
    slaves would be treated as “equals” in the eyes of the law.

     Instructions: Read the text of Justice Brown’s majority decision on
    the Plessy v. Ferguson case (1896).  
        
     Note on the Text: This decision served as the basis for the
    notorious Jim Crow laws and the segregation that took place in the
    United States until the 1950s.  Brown’s decision expressed the
    sentiments of many Americans, especially in the South who felt
    that—although slavery had ended—black Americans were different from
    white Americans and that as long as equality existed, separation
    between the races was a legitimate and legal course of action. This
    court decision effectively legitimized the move toward segregation
    practices begun earlier in the South and provided an impetus for
    further segregation laws, which would be upheld until the
    mid-twentieth century.
