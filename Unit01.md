**Unit 1: Foundations** <span id="1"></span> 
**This unit will provide you with an understanding of political theory
in the earliest days of the American colonies to the beginning of the
American Revolution.  You will learn about the mindset of the earliest
colonists, their rationale for coming to the New World and how their
concepts of freedom and unity helped shape later feelings of revolution
and independence.  In addition, this unit will also highlight how early
American thought was conflicted about issues such as religion,
independence, unity, freedom, equality and slavery.  This unit will help
you understand the diverse roots of American political thought and help
demonstrate how these roots influenced the birth of the American
nation.**

-   **Reading: U.S. Constitution On-line’s version of “The Mayflower
    Compact”**
    Link: U.S. Constitution On-line’s version of “[The Mayflower
    Compact](http://www.usconstitution.net/mayflower.html)” (HTML)  
      
     Also available in:  
     [PDF](http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/document.htm)  
      
     Instructions: Read the brief introduction and the text of the
    Mayflower Compact.  
      
     Note on the Text: The Mayflower Compact was an early document that
    underscored some of the goals of the individuals who left Europe to
    travel to America on the Mayflower.  This agreement served as the
    basis for the mutual understanding and commitment of all of the men
    aboard the Mayflower to create a government that would provide for
    the common good.  This philosophy is a major component of later
    American political thought.  To view in PDF format, please follow

    Charity](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/A-Model-of-Christian-Charity.pdf)”

     Instructions: Read the introduction and the text of “A Model of
    Christian Charity.”  To view in another PDF format, please follow
    the "PDF" link above; select the link at the bottom of the page.  
      
     Note on the Text: In this text, John Winthrop, a Puritan arriving
    in America in the 1600s, explains his vision of the new community
    that he and his fellow Puritans would create in America.  The
    religious undertones you will notice in this text are representative
    of the religious sentiment that tended to characterize those who
    came to America at the time.  Note that religious freedom was not
    the true motivation behind leaving for America: many of those who
    arrived wanted to have the opportunity to practice their own
    religion but did not necessarily tolerate other religions.  This
    mindset was influential in colonial politics and in the shaping of
    the relationship between politics and religion in the United States
    going forward.

     Instructions: Read the introduction and the text of “The Bloody
    Tenet of Persecution.”  
        
     Note on the Text: In this text, Roger Williams, a Puritan who was
    banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635, explains his
    feelings about the relationship between religion and civil
    government.  Williams’ experience in Massachusetts and his feelings
    about religious tolerance led to his founding of Rhode Island, the
    first colony to allow religious freedom.  Williams, therefore,
    played a major role in helping shape American political thought and
    the concept of religious freedom, tolerance, and separation of
    church and state.

    Sons of Liberty articulate some of their objections to British
    action in the colonies and convey the overall sentiment of the
    patriots in the late 1700s.

    of Correspondence after the Boston Tea Party (December 16, 1773), a
    secret protest staged by the Boston Sons of Liberty against the
    British royal crown.  The participants in the Boston Tea Party
    assembled to protest unfair taxes, but the consequences of their
    actions (the passage of the “Intolerable Acts”) were profound.  This
    reading conveys the British response to the Boston Tea Party and the
    colonial sentiment concerning this punishment.
