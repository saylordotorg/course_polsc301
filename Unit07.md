**Unit 7: Progressivism and The New Deal** <span id="7"></span> 
**In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Americans began to question the
wisdom and priorities of those leading the industrial revolution.  Rapid
industrialization yielded great wealth and opportunity for some, but was
also blamed for the increases in poverty, class divisions, violence, and
racism related to immigration.  In this unit, you will study the
resultant focus on social and economic issues and the rise of a variety
of reform movements.     **

    violent overthrow of oppressive institutions was sometimes
    necessary.  Few as they were in number, anarchists were viewed with
    alarm by the American community when the movement experienced a
    resurgence in the late nineteenth century. In 1901, President
    Theodore Roosevelt denounced anarchism as “a crime against the whole
    human race.”

    immigrant in the United States, but readers were more concerned with
    the large portion of the book pertaining to the corruption of the
    American meatpacking industry, and the book is now often interpreted
    and taught as a journalist’s exposure of the poor health conditions
    within the industry at that time.

    of arguments based on the nation’s founding documents. Anthony died
