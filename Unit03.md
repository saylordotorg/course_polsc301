**Unit 3: Building a New Government** <span id="3"></span> 
**As the new nation was forming, questions of governmental supremacy had
not yet been fully answered.  As you will read, the first president
under the Constitution, George Washington, left the country with
important parting words in his farewell address on the issue of internal
factions.  He warned that splits within the government would not be good
for the country as a whole.  However, before, during, and after
Washington’s presidency, leaders continued to be concerned with the
distribution of power between the national government and its states. 
Some argued that the states should retain significant power in order to
control the power of the national government.  Others argued that the
national government required strength in order to remain a formidable
power at home and abroad.  As with the ratification debate, the nation
was split in its approach and against Washington’s advice, these
differences of opinion led to the creation of the first political
parties in America.  In this unit, you will study how the balance of
power began to evolve and how the issue of state verses federal
supremacy divided the nation.**

    heed Washington’s advice; however, because of the political climate
    in the country and around the world, many were not successful.

     Note on the Reading: The creation of the Bank of the United States
    was a major point of contention between many leaders within the
    early republic.  Hamilton and his supporters of the bank believed it
    was necessary to create a centralized national bank to pay off debts
    and ensure national economic stability.  On the other hand, many
    others (including Thomas Jefferson and James Madison) believed that
    the creation of a strong centralized bank infringed upon state
    sovereignty.  Eventually, Washington sided with Hamilton and the
    bank was created.  However, the debate between Jefferson and
    Hamilton would prove to be divisive and would foster the creation of
    the first political parties, the Federalists and the
    Democrat-Republicans.
