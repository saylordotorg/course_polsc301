**Unit 4: Individualism and Democracy** <span id="4"></span> 
**This unit of the course focuses on the philosophical concept of the
relationship between the individual and the democratic state.  In the
early to mid-1800s, a selection of theorists began to question whether
the individual could tolerate the conformity required of a democratic
system of governance.  In this unit, you will study the writings of
these authors and investigate their arguments for the preservation of
the individual in a democratic state.  You may notice that these
theoretical approaches have had a substantial impact upon the issues of
slavery and civil rights (to be explored in subsequent units).**

     Instructions: Please read the text of Emerson’s 1840 essay,
    “Self-Reliance.”  Emerson, an essayist, lecturer, and poet, was a
    key figure in the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-nineteenth
    century.  Among the transcendentalists’ core beliefs was the belief
    in an ideal spirituality that “transcends” the physical and
    empirical and is realized only through the individual’s intuition,
    rather than through the doctrines of established religions.
    Followers of this movement championed individualism and were
    prescient critics of the countervailing pressures of society.  Note
    that this reading will cover the material you need to know for
    subunits 4.2.1–4.2.2.

     Note on the Text: Robert Owen was an English social reformer and
    one of the founders of utopian socialism, a movement which was
    highly influential to transcendentalists. Followers of this tenet
    believed that social ownership of the means of production could be
    achieved by voluntary and peaceful surrender of their holdings by
    propertied groups. As a result, hundreds of “utopian communities”
    were formed in the mid-nineteenth century, including Owen’s New
    Harmony, Indiana community, where he sought to establish common
    ownership of property and abolish religion.

     Note on the Text: de Tocqueville was a French political thinker and
    historian.  Writing from the perspective of a detached social
    scientist, Tocqueville wrote of his travels through America in the
    early nineteenth century when the market revolution, Western
    expansion, and Jacksonian democracy were radically transforming the
    fabric of American life. He saw democracy as an equation that
    balanced liberty and equality, concern for the individual as well as
    the community. By the twentieth century, *Democracy in America* had
    become a classic work of political science, social science, and
    history.
